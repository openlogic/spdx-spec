<h2 id="section1">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines
  an <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all">RDF</a>
  vocabulary and related file formats to allow copyright, licensing
  and component information related to software packages.  The aim of
  this abstract model and the related interchange formats is to
  facilitate license and other policy compliance.

<p>Companies and organizations are widely using and reusing open
  source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated
  licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence
  that each Organization performs independently.  These activities
  include a manual and/or automated scan of software and
  identification of associated licenses followed by manual
  verification.</p>

<p>Software development teams across the globe use the same open
  source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate
  collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis
  activities.  As a result, many groups are performing the same work
  leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information being
  created.  This data description and exchange mechanism will allow
  information about software packages and related content to be
  collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time
  and improving data accuracy.</p>
    
<h3 id="section1.1">1.1 Structure of this document</h3>

<p>This document divided into 4 major sections.  The first describes
  an abstract model for describing packages (including the files a
  package contains) and the copyright ownership and licensing of those
  packages and files.  The second section describes a simple text
  based format for representing instances the abstract model described
  above for particular packages.  The third section describes an
  RDF/XML format for representing instances the abstract model
  described above for particular packages.  The forth section
  describes the a registry of licenses maintained by the SPDX group
  which contains many of the common open source licenses in use today.</p>
