<h2 id="section1">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines
  an <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all">RDF</a>
  vocabulary and related file formats to allow copyright, licensing
  and component information related to software packages.  The aim of
  this abstract model and the related interchange formats is to
  facilitate license and other policy compliance.

<p>Companies and organizations are widely using and reusing open
  source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated
  licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence
  that each Organization performs independently.  These activities
  include a manual and/or automated scan of software and
  identification of associated licenses followed by manual
  verification.</p>

<p>Software development teams across the globe use the same open
  source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate
  collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis
  activities.  As a result, many groups are performing the same work
  leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information being
  created.  This data description and exchange mechanism will allow
  information about software packages and related content to be
  collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time
  and improving data accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="section1.1">1.1 Overview</h3>

<p>And SDPX document can take the form of a simple text format
  (refered to as the tag-value format) or any RDF serialization
  format.  The tag-value format is intended to be easy for humans
  create and undertand.  The following is an example of an SPDX
  document rendered in the tag-value format.</p>
    
<pre><code>
SPDXVersion: SPDX-1.0

<p>The conceptual model of SPDX is defined in RDF.  RDF is a standard
model for data interchange on the Web.  The tag-value format is a
serialization of RDF with some assumptions built in to make SPDX files
more understandable and easier to produce.</p>

<p>SPDX documents are innately RDF.  This means that any RDF document
may also be rendered in any file format that support RDF.  This
includes RDF/XML, XHTML+RDFa, Turtle, etc.  Tools may, at their
discretion, choose to use any or all of these formats (including the
tag-value format) to encode SPDX information.</p>

<h3 id="section1.2">1.2 Structure of this document</h3>

<p>This document divided into 3 major sections.  The first describes
  an abstract model for describing packages and files and the
  copyright ownership and licensing of those packages and files.  The
  second section describes how the SPDX vocabulary is rendered into
  the tag-value format. The third section describes the a registry of
  licenses maintained by the SPDX group which contains many of the
  common open source licenses in use today.</p>
