<h2 id="section1">1. Rationale</h2>

<h3 id="section1.1">1.1 Charter</h3>

<p>To create a set of data exchange standards that enable companies and organizations to share + and component information (metadata) for software packages and related content with the aim of facilitating license and other policy compliance.</p>

<h3 id="section1.2">1.2 Definition</h3>

<p property="rdfs:comment">The Software Package Data Exchange(SPDX™)
  specification is a standard format for communicating the components,
  licenses and copyrights associated with a software package.  An SPDX
  file is associated with a particular software package and contains
  information about that package in the SPDX format.</p>

<h3 id="section1.3">1.3. Why is a common format for data exchange needed?</h3>

<p>Companies and organizations (collectively "Organizations") are
  widely using and reusing open source and other software
  packages. Compliance with the associated licenses requires a set of
  analysis activities and due diligence that each Organization
  performs independently including: a manual and/or automated scan of
  software and identification of associated licenses followed by
  manual verification. Software development teams across the globe use
  the same open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to
  facilitate collaboration on the analysis or share the results of
  these analysis activities.  As a result, many groups are performing
  the same work leading to duplicated efforts and redundant
  information being created.  The SPDX working group seeks to create a
  data exchange format so that information about software packages and
  related content, may be collected and shared in a common format with
  the goal of saving time and improving data accuracy.</p>
    
<h3 id="section1.4">1.4. What does this specification cover?</h3>


<h4 id="section1.4.1">1.4.1. Identification Information</h4>

<p> Meta data to associate analysis results with a specific package.
  This includes a unique identifier that identifies a specific
  instance of a package and permits correlation to the corresponding
  SPDX file.</p>

<h4 id="section1.4.2">1.4.2. Overview Information</h4>

<p>Facts that are common properties of the entire package.</p>

<h4 id="section1.4.3">1.4.3 File Specific Information</h4>

<p>Facts ( e.g. copyrights, licenses) that are specific to
	each file included in the package.</p>

<h4 id="section1.4.4">1.4.4 Common Licenses</h4>
<p>list of common licenses likely to be encountered and a
  standardized naming convention for referring to these licenses
  within an SPDX document.  This naming convention will also be the
  basis for extending this set of common licenses over time.</p>

<h4 id="section1.4.5">1.4.5. Evolution Hooks</h4>

<p> A set of mechanisms that permit extending the specification in a
  structured manner under specific future versions of the
  specification.</p>

<h3 id="section1.5">1.5 What is not covered in the specification?</h3>

<p>Information that cannot be derived from an inspection (whether manual or
  using automated tools) of the package to be analyzed.</p>

<p>How the data stored in and SPDX file is used by the recipient
  identification of any patent(s) which may or may not relate to the
  package.</p>

<p>Legal interpretation of the licenses or any compliance actions
  that might need to be taken.</p>

<h3 id="section1.6">1.6 Format Requirements:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p> Must be in a human readable form.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Must be in a syntax that a software tool can read and
      write.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Must be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness
      independent of how it was generated (human or tool).</p></li>
  
  <li><p>The SPDX file character set must support UTF-8
      encoding.</p></li>
  
  
  <li><p>Must permit automated specification syntax
      validation.</p></li>
  
  
  <li><p>Resource Description Framework (RDF) will be used to 
      represent certain semantic information.</p></li>
