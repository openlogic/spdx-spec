<h2 id="section3">3 Tag-Value Format</h2>

<p>This section describes a simple, text based, format for
  representing the instances of the SPDX abstract model.</p>

<p>The SPDX tag-value format is a simple name-value pair format.
  Tag-value pairs are grouped into sections based onto what entity the
  tag relates.</p>

<p>A tag-value is represented as a line starting with a tag name
  followed by a ":" character.  The value of the tag is either the
  remainder of the line after the ":" or it is a multi-line value.
  Multi-line values are supported by the use of a triple quote
  mechanism.  If the sequences <code>"""</code> is first
  non-whitespace characters of a value, the value is consider to be
  the remainder of that line and any further lines until a
  the <code>"""</code> sequence is encountered again.</p>

<p>Sections are delineated by a line that identifies the type of the
  section and an identification of the entity being described.  The
  identification is either a URI that is enclosed in angle brackets
  ("&lt;" and "&gt;") or it is an node id.  A node id is a unique id that is
  scoped to the current file.  A node id may not contain spaces.</p>

<h3>3.1 Grammar</h3>

<p>The syntax of SPDX files described formally is:</p>

  <pre><code class="tag-value grammar">
      tagvaluefile   = *(tagandvalue / sectionheader)
      tagandvalue    = tag *WSP ":" *WSP value
      tag            = *tagchar
      tagchar        = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "."
      value          = multilinevalue / *UNICODEVCHAR *WSP CRLF
      multilinevalue = 3DQUOTE *UNICODEVCHAR 3DQUOTE *WSP CRLF
      sectionheader  = "[" *WSP resourcetype *WSP entityid *WSP "]"
      resourcetype   = *tagchar  ; RDF class name with an implied prefix &lt;http://spdx.org/vocab#&gt;
      entityid       = uriref / nodeid
      uriref         = "&lt;" xsd:anyURI "&gt;"
      nodeid         = *tagchar
  </code></pre>

<h3>3.2 Mapping to RDF</h3>
 
<p>Each tag-value pair maps to an RDF statement.  The subject of the
  pair is the entity of the section in which it occurs or the SPDXDoc
  entity if it occurs before the first section header.  The predicate
  is tag name prefixed with <code>http://spdx.org/vocab#</code>.</p>
