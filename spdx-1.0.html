<h2 id="section1">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines
  an <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all">RDF</a>
  vocabulary and related file formats to allow copyright, licensing
  and component information related to software packages.  The aim of
  this abstract model and the related interchange formats is to
  facilitate license and other policy compliance.

<p>Companies and organizations are widely using and reusing open
  source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated
  licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence
  that each Organization performs independently.  These activities
  include a manual and/or automated scan of software and
  identification of associated licenses followed by manual
  verification.</p>

<p>Software development teams across the globe use the same open
  source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate
  collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis
  activities.  As a result, many groups are performing the same work
  leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information being
  created.  This data description and exchange mechanism will allow
  information about software packages and related content to be
  collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time
  and improving data accuracy.</p>
    
<h3 id="section1.1">1.1 Structure of this document</h3>

<p>This document divided into 4 major sections.  The first describes
  an abstract model for describing packages (including the files a
  package contains) and the copyright ownership and licensing of those
  packages and files.  The second section describes a simple text
  based format for representing instances the abstract model described
  above for particular packages.  The third section describes an
  RDF/XML format for representing instances the abstract model
  described above for particular packages.  The forth section
  describes the a registry of licenses maintained by the SPDX group
  which contains many of the common open source licenses in use today.</p>

<h2 id="section2">2 Vocabulary</h2>

<p>This section defines the vocabulary used to describe packages,
  licenses, copyrights and other information in SPDX.  This vocabulary
  represents the abstract model of SPDX.</p>

<h3>2.1 Classes</h3>

<p>An SPDX document is composed of a set of resources.  A resource is
  an entity such a file, license or package. Each resources has a
  class.  The class of a resource lets SPDX consumer know what sort of
  resource it is.</p>

<p>This is a list of the types of entities defined by SPDX, and what
  properties are associated with resources of these types.</p>

<h3>2.2 Properties</h3>

<p>Each resource in an SPDX file has as set of properties which
  describes that item.  The class also defines what properties are
  allowed for that resource.  The value of a property may be a literal
  value or a resource of a specific class.</p>

<p>This section provides a details description of the various
  properties use to convey package data.  Some of the properties apply
  to more than one class of resource.</p>

<div class="rdf-property" about="#SPDXVersion" typeof="owl:DatatypeProperty">
  <h4 id="SPDXVersion">2.2.1 <span property="rdfs:label">SPDXVersion</span></h4>
  <p property="rdfs:comment">This property applies to <a rel="rdfs:domain"
  href="#SPDXDoc">SPDXDoc</a> and provide a reference number that can be
    used to understand how to parse and interpret the rest of the
    file.  It will enable both future changes to the specification and
    to support backward compatibility.</p>

  <p>The version identifier consists a format identifier, a major and
    a minor version indicator.  The Major field will be incremented
    when incompatible changes are made to the specification.  The
    Minor field will be incremented when any change is made that is
    fully backwards compatibility.  An SPDX processor may safe read a
    file that has the expected format identifier and major
    version.</p>

  <p>The value of the SPDXVersion property for all datasets encoded in
    this verison must be: <code>SPDX-1.0</code></p>
</div> <!-- SPDXVersion -->


<div class="rdf-property" about="#CreatedBy" typeof="owl:DatatypeProperty">
  <h4 id="CreatedBy">2.2.2 <span property="rdfs:label">CreatedBy</span></h4>

  <p property="rdfs:comment">This property identifies how information
    in the <a href="#SPDXDoc" rel="rdfs:domain">SPDXDoc</a> was
    generated.  The value of CreatedBy is an <span about="#Created"
    rel="rdfs:range" href="xsd:string"/>xsd:string</a>.  The format of
    this string may indicate a person, tool or organization.</p>

  <pre><code class="grammar">
      company    = "Company:" *WSP name *WSP ["(" email ")"]
      tool       = "Tool:" *WSP name
      person     = "Person:" *WSP name *WSP ["(" email ")"]
      name       = *VUNICODECHAR
      email      = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_") "@" domainpart 1*("." domainpart)
      domainpart = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_") 
  </code></pre>

  <p>For example, "Person: John Doe (john.doe@example.com)" or "Company: My Company, Inc" (depending on which is accountable) or "Tool: spdx-gen 1.0".</p>
</div> <!-- CreatedBy -->

<div class="rdf-property" about="#Created" typeof="owl:DatatypeProperty">
  <h4 id="Created">2.2.3 <span property="rdfs:label">Created</span></h4>

  <p>This property identifies when the analysis was done and
    the <a href="#SPDXDoc" rel="rdfs:domain">SPDXDoc</a> was
    originally created.  The value of this property is
    an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime"><span about="#Created"
    rel="rdfs:range" href="xsd:dateTime"/>xsd:dateTime</a></p>

  <p>This property refines the definition of
  <a rel="rdfs:subPropertyOf"
  href="dc:created"/><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-created">dc:created</a>.</p>
</div> <!-- Created -->

<div class="rdf-property" about="#ReviewedBy" typeof="owl:DatatypeProperty">
  <h4 id="ReviewedBy">2.2.4 <span property="rdfs:label">ReviewedBy</span></h4>

  <p property="rdfs:comment">This property allows the recording of any
    reviews that have been done of a <a href="#SPDXDoc"
    rel="rdfs:domain">SPDXDoc</a>. The value of this property is
    an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string"><span about="#ReviewedBy"
    rel="rdfs:range" href="xsd:string"/>xsd:string</a> containing the
    reviews name and, optionally, email address and the date on which
    the review took place.  </p>

  <pre><code class="grammar">
      review = "person *WSP timestamp"
  </code></pre>

  <p>For example, "Person: John Doe (john.doe@example.com) 2010-11-02T17:02:03Z".</p>

  <p>Note that there is no requirement for a particular reviewer to
    add their name to the file, however it may be important for
    participants in the software supply chain to validate whether
    upstream providers have reviewed the SPDX file.  This can be
    considered as an equivalent to "signed off" or "reviewed by".
    Additional reviewers can be added after the original version of
    the SPDX file is created and can occur as an append to the
    original file.</p>
</div> <!-- ReviewedBy -->

<div class="rdf-property" about="#DeclaredName" typeof="owl:DatatypeProperty">
  <h4 id="DeclaredName">2.2.5 <span property="rdfs:label">DeclaredName</span></h4>

  <p>This property records the name and version of
    a <a rel="rdfs:domain" href="#Package">Package</a>.  The value is
    an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string"><span about="#DeclaredName"
    rel="rdfs:range" href="xsd:string"/>xsd:string</a> that contains
    the full name, including version information if known, of the
    package.  This property in intended for primarily human
    consumption so the arrangement of this information is not formally
    defined.</p>

</div> <!-- DeclaredName -->

<div class="rdf-property" about="#MachineName" typeof="owl:DatatypeProperty">
  <h4 id="MachineName">2.2.6 <span property="rdfs:label">MachineName</span></h4>
  
  <p>This property stores the file name of the <a rel="rdfs:domain"
    href="#Package">Package</a>.  The value is
    an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string"><span about="#MachineName"
    rel="rdfs:range" href="xsd:string"/>xsd:string</a> that is the
    machine generated file name and version typically includes
    extensions to indicated the packaging and compression methods
    used.</p>

  <p>For example, "zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz".</p>
</div> <!-- MachineName -->

<div class="rdf-property" about="#SHA1" typeof="owl:DatatypeProperty">
  <h4 id="SHA1">2.2.7 <span property="rdfs:label">SHA1</span></h4>
  
  <p>This property provides an independently reproducible mechanism
    that permits verification that a specific <a rel="rdfs:domain"
    href="#Package">Package</a> or <a rel="rdfs:domain"
    href="#File">File</a> correlates to the information in this SPDX
    file. This identifier enables a recipient to determine if any file
    in the original package has been changed.  The value is the
    hexadecimal encoded SHA1 hash of the package or file in
    an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string"><span about="#SHA1"
    rel="rdfs:range" href="xsd:string"/>xsd:string</a>.  The length of
    this values is always 40 characters.</p>

</div> <!-- SHA1 -->


<h2 id="section3">3 Tag-Value Format</h2>

<p>This section describes a simple, text based, format for
  representing the instances of the SPDX abstract model.</p>

<p>The SPDX tag-value format is a simple name-value pair format.
  Tag-value pairs are grouped into sections based onto what entity the
  tag relates.</p>

<p>A tag-value is represented as a line starting with a tag name
  followed by a ":" character.  The value of the tag is either the
  remainder of the line after the ":" or it is a multi-line value.
  Multi-line values are supported by the use of a triple quote
  mechanism.  If the sequences <code>"""</code> is first
  non-whitespace characters of a value, the value is consider to be
  the remainder of that line and any further lines until a
  the <code>"""</code> sequence is encountered again.</p>

<p>Sections are delineated by a line that identifies the type of the
  section and an identification of the entity being described.  The
  identification is either a URI that is enclosed in angle brackets
  ("&lt;" and "&gt;") or it is an node id.  A node id is a unique id that is
  scoped to the current file.  A node id may not contain spaces.</p>

<h5>Example 1</h5>

<pre><code>
SPDXVersion: SPDX-1.0
CreatedBy: Tool: spdx-gen 1.0

[Package &lt;http://oss.net/foo-1.0.tar.gz&gt;]
DeclaredLicense: FullLicense-1
DeclaredLicense: GPL2
Description: """This
is along
multiline value"""

[License FullLicnse-1]
LicenseText: """
Some terms and conditions
"""
</code></pre>

<h3>3.1 Grammar</h3>

<p>The syntax of SPDX files described formally is:</p>

  <pre><code class="tag-value grammar">
      tagvaluefile   = *(tagandvalue / sectionheader)
      tagandvalue    = tag *WSP ":" *WSP value
      tag            = *tagchar
      tagchar        = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "."
      value          = multilinevalue / *UNICODEVCHAR *WSP CRLF
      multilinevalue = 3DQUOTE *UNICODEVCHAR 3DQUOTE *WSP CRLF
      sectionheader  = "[" *WSP resourcetype *WSP entityid *WSP "]"
      resourcetype   = *tagchar  ; RDF class name with an implied prefix &lt;http://spdx.org/vocab#&gt;
      entityid       = uriref / nodeid
      uriref         = "&lt;" xsd:anyURI "&gt;"
      nodeid         = *tagchar
  </code></pre>

<h3>3.2 Mapping to RDF</h3>
 
<p>Each tag-value pair maps to an RDF statement.  The subject of the
  pair is the entity of the section in which it occurs or the SPDXDoc
  entity if it occurs before the first section header.  The predicate
  is tag name prefixed with <code>http://spdx.org/vocab#</code>.</p>
