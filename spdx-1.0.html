<h2 id="section1">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines
  an <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all">RDF</a>
  vocabulary and related file formats to allow copyright, licensing
  and component information related to software packages.  The aim of
  this abstract model and the related interchange formats is to
  facilitate license and other policy compliance.

<p>Companies and organizations are widely using and reusing open
  source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated
  licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence
  that each Organization performs independently.  These activities
  include a manual and/or automated scan of software and
  identification of associated licenses followed by manual
  verification.</p>

<p>Software development teams across the globe use the same open
  source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate
  collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis
  activities.  As a result, many groups are performing the same work
  leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information being
  created.  This data description and exchange mechanism will allow
  information about software packages and related content to be
  collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time
  and improving data accuracy.</p>
    
<h3 id="section1.1">1.1 Structure of this document</h3>

<p>This document divided into 4 major sections.  The first describes
  an abstract model for describing packages (including the files a
  package contains) and the copyright ownership and licensing of those
  packages and files.  The second section describes a simple text
  based format for representing instances the abstract model described
  above for particular packages.  The third section describes an
  RDF/XML format for representing instances the abstract model
  described above for particular packages.  The forth section
  describes the a registry of licenses maintained by the SPDX group
  which contains many of the common open source licenses in use today.</p>

<h2 id="section2">2 Ontology</h2>

<p>This section defines the abstract model underlying SPDX in terms of
  RDF.</p.

    for a particular reviewer to add their name to the file, however
    it may be important for participants in the software supply chain

<h2 id="section3">3 Tag-Value Format</h2>

<p>This section describes a simple, text based, format for
  representing the instances of the SPDX abstract model.</p>

<p>The SPDX tag-value format is a simple name-value pair format.
  Tag-value pairs are grouped into sections based onto what entity the
  tag relates.</p>

<p>A tag-value is represented as a line starting with a tag name
  followed by a ":" character.  The value of the tag is either the
  remainder of the line after the ":" or it is a multi-line value.
  Multi-line values are supported by the use of a triple quote
  mechanism.  If the sequences <code>"""</code> is first
  non-whitespace characters of a value, the value is consider to be
  the remainder of that line and any further lines until a
  the <code>"""</code> sequence is encountered again.</p>

<p>Sections are delineated by a line that identifies the type of the
  section and an identification of the entity being described.  The
  identification is either a URI that is enclosed in angle brackets
  ("&lt;" and "&gt;") or it is an node id.  A node id is a unique id that is
  scoped to the current file.  A node id may not contain spaces.</p>

<h5>Example 1</h5>

<pre><code>
SPDXVersion: SPDX-1.0
CreatedBy: Tool: spdx-gen 1.0

[Package &lt;http://oss.net/foo-1.0.tar.gz&gt;]
DeclaredLicense: FullLicense-1
DeclaredLicense: GPL2
Description: """This
is along
multiline value"""

[License FullLicnse-1]
LicenseText: """
Some terms and conditions
"""
</code></pre>

<h3>3.1 Grammar</h3>

<p>The syntax of SPDX files described formally is:</p>

  <pre><code class="tag-value grammar">
      tagvaluefile   = *(tagandvalue / sectionheader)
      tagandvalue    = tag *WSP ":" *WSP value
      tag            = *tagchar
      tagchar        = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "."
      value          = multilinevalue / *UNICODEVCHAR *WSP CRLF
      multilinevalue = 3DQUOTE *UNICODEVCHAR 3DQUOTE *WSP CRLF
      sectionheader  = "[" *WSP resourcetype *WSP entityid *WSP "]"
      resourcetype   = *tagchar  ; RDF class name with an implied prefix &lt;http://spdx.org/vocab#&gt;
      entityid       = uriref / nodeid
      uriref         = "&lt;" xsd:anyURI "&gt;"
      nodeid         = *tagchar
  </code></pre>

<h3>3.2 Mapping to RDF</h3>
 
<p>Each tag-value pair maps to an RDF statement.  The subject of the
  pair is the entity of the section in which it occurs or the SPDXDoc
  entity if it occurs before the first section header.  The predicate
  is tag name prefixed with <code>http://spdx.org/vocab#</code>.</p>
