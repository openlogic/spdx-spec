Getting started

The complete spec file is `spdx-1.0.html`.  This file is generated by
combining the various sections in this project.  To generate the
complete spec run `rake spdx-1.0.html`.  

An abstract representation of the RDF ontology defined in the spec can
be generated (via WonderWeb) by `rake abstract`.

An RDF/XML representation of the RDF ontology can be generated using
`rake spdx-1.0-ont.rdf`.
