			<OL>
				<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Purpose:</B> Provide a reference number
				that can be used to understand how to parse and interpret the
				rest of the file.  It will enable both future changes to the
				specification and to support backward compatibility.   The
				version number consists of a Major and Minor version indicator. 
				The Major field will be incramented when one or more sections are
				created, modified or deleted.  The Minor field will be
				incremented when either only the fields within a section are
				modified or standard recognized licenses are added to appendix.</P></LI>

				<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Intent:</B> Here, parties exchanging
				Identification Information in accordance with SPDX specification
				need to provide 100% transparency as to which SPDX specification
				such Identification Information is conforming to.</P></LI>

				<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Purpose:</B> Identify how the meta data
				information in the SPDX file was generated. If it was generated
				manually, it should indicate – who did the analysis.  If the
				information in the file was generated with a software tool, the
				file should indicate an identifier and version for that tool.

				<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Intent:</B> Here, the generation method

				<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Purpose:</B> List of the people who
				have reviewed the SPDX file and the date of that review.  Note
				that there is no requirement for a particular reviewer to add
				their name to the file, however it may be important for
				participants in the software supply chain to validate whether
				upstream providers have reviewed the SPDX file.  This can be
				considered as an equivalent to “signed off” or “reviewed
				by”.  Additional reviewers can be added after the original
				version of the SPDX file is created and can occur as an append to
				the original file.

				<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Intent:</B> Here, as time progresses
				certain reviewers will begin to gain credibility as reliable.
