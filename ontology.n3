"""
Companies and organizations (collectively “Organizations”) are widely using and reusing open source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence that each Organization performs independently including: a manual and/or automated scan of software and identification of associated licenses followed by manual verification. Software development teams across the globe use the same open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis activities. As a result, many groups are performing the same work leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information being created. The SPDX working group seeks to create a data exchange format so that information about software packages and related content, may be collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time and improving data accuracy.

Purpose: Provide a reference number that can be used to understand how to parse and interpret the rest of the file. It will enable both future changes to the specification and to support backward compatibility.	The version number consists of a Major and Minor version indicator. The Major field will be incramented when one or more sections are created, modified or deleted. The Minor field will be incremented when either only the fields within a section are modified or standard recognized licenses are added to appendix.

Intent: Here, parties exchanging Identification Information in accordance with SPDX specification need to provide 100% transparency as to which SPDX specification such Identification Information is conforming to.

Data Format: SPDX-M.N where: M is Major version number, N is minor version number.

Example:
    SPDXVersion: SPDX-1.0

Purpose: Identify how the meta data information in the SPDX file was generated. If it was generated manually, it should indicate – who did the analysis. If the information in the file was generated with a software tool, the file should indicate an identifier and version for that tool.

Intent: Here, the generation method will assist the reader of the Identification Information in self determining the general reliability/accuracy of the Identification Information.

Data Format: ”Person: person name” (with optional email) or "Company: company" (depending on which is accountable) or "Tool: tool identifier - version”.  If multiple participants in the analysis, then they should be indicated with separate instances.

Example:
    CreatedBy: Person: Jane Doe (jane.doe@company.com)

Data Format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ where: YYYY is year, MM is month with leading zero, DD is day with leading zero, T is delimiter for time, hh is hours with leading zero in 24 hour time, mm is minutes with leading zero, ss is seconds with leading zero, and Z is universal time indicator.
